Blocky is an innovative platform that seamlessly connects data seekers with providers through the strategic use of AI-powered autonomous agents and advanced blockchain technology. Blocky employs autonomous agents to perform tasks such as matching users with the most suitable data providers, negotiating terms, and creating secure, tailored blockchain contracts. The platform leverages a sophisticated vector space model to analyze user inputs and match them with the ideal providers based on similarity in requirements. Additionally, Blocky incorporates the Bloom AI model to enhance the accuracy and relevance of matches by efficiently filtering through vast amounts of data. Integrated with the Google Gemini API, Blocky offers a user-friendly interface where users can easily interact with AI agents to specify their precise data needs.
